<blockquote>
<p>Speaker(s): 
Tom Bamford, Karen Leech
Contractors:
What happens when you join a project?
Do you sit there the first few days trying to think of what you need?
working out where the codebase is?
Are there any assets required?
What is the dev/build process?
Who to ask about logins and accounts?
Do you feel awkward asking who to invoice, what payment terms are?</p>

<p>Companies:
How to get contractors to be productive from day 1.
How to stop them asking questions that seem obvious to you.
Why you should be providing on boarding documentation every time.</p>

<p>We will be presenting a list of items you should consider including, and asking for at the beginning of &gt;every project joined.</p>

<p>Time allowing, we can discuss any other requirements and touch on documenting Drupal projects for a rapid &gt;beginning.</p>
